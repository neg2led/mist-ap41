---- Overriding the config the cloud sends the AP -----------------

4 files, which normally do not exist, can be placed in /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/
and get merged into the config the cloud sends to the AP. This is useful for
testing new features the cloud doesn't yet configure, or test configurations
the cloud won't generate.

The files are

   /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/local_defaults.config
   /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/local_overrides.config
   /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/local_radio_overrides.config
   /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/local_wlan_overrides.config

The local_defaults are applied before the cloud's configuration. They override
the hardcoded defaults in the AP's configuration.

The local_overrides file is applied on top of the cloud's configuration. It
is useful for changing globals. However when changing lists (like the WLANs
for example) you end up replacing the entire list, rather than adding or altering
one member of the list, which is difficult to use.

Thus the local_radio_overrides file, which is applied on top of the Radios sent
from the cloud, and the local_wlan_overrides file, which is applied on top of the
WLANs sent from the cloud.

These two first files are fragments of configuration files. The local_wlan_overrides
is a map from SSID or UUID to just the WLAN's configuration.

Errors in parsing (JSON syntax errors; unknown WLANs) will show up in ep-control.log.

Files in /rw/etc/mist/ep-control/ survive reboots and upgrades. Only holding
down the 'reset' button while rebooting, or doing a `progfw` in u-boot will
erase them (and the rest of /rw).

---- Examples ------------------------------------------------------

1) To turn off pcap on R0,R1, and R2:

::local_overrides.config::
{
 "Monitor":{
  "Enabled": false,
  "Radiotap": false,
  "SteerEnabled": false,
  "PcapWLAN": {
   "ClientFirstBkgrdEnabled": false
  }
 }
}
::::

2) Turn off BSS-Load beacon element[1] on a WLAN with SSID "xyz":

::local_wlan_overrides.config::
{ 
 "xyz":{
  "WNM": {
   "BSSLoad":false
  }
 }
}
::::

3) Force the 2.4GHz radio to channel 1, 40Mhz wide, and the 5GHz radio to channel 64, 80MHz wide:

::local_radio_overrides.config::
{
 "2.4":{
  "Channel":1,
  "Width":40
 },
 "5":{
  "Channel":64,
  "Width":80
 }
}


[1] note that the way BSS-Load works in wl.ko it has to be disabled on all WLANs
on a radio for it to be absent from the beacons of any WLAN. That's a broadcom
quirk we haven't bothered to fix since it doesn't really break anything we know
about.
